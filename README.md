## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Phrase grounding (PG) aims to localize objects referred to by noun phrases in an image. Recent works have explored either weakly supervised PG (without region-level annotations) or zero-shot PG (generalizing from seen to unseen categories). However, both settings have limitations in real-world applications due to scarce annotations and limited category coverage during training.

In this paper, we propose **WS-ZSG**, a novel framework for **Zero-shot Phrase Grounding under Weak Supervision**. Our approach is built upon three key alignment strategies:

1. **Region-Text Alignment (RTA)**: Leverages CLIP to establish region-level attribute associations between image regions and text descriptions.
2. **Domain Alignment (DomA)**: Minimizes the distributional gap between seen classes in training data and those from pre-training domains.
3. **Category Alignment (CatA)**: Integrates category semantics and region-category relationships to enhance generalization to unseen categories.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing zero-shot approaches and achieves competitive performance compared to fully and weakly supervised methods. The code and data will be made publicly available after the double-blind review phase.
