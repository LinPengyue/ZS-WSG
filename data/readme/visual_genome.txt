1. download v1.2 images and region descriptions from "https://visualgenome.org/api/v0/api_home.html"
2. put all images under folder: "VG_Images"
3. put "region_descriptions.json" under folder: "VG_Annotations"
4. make sure "imgs_data.pickle" (already included) is under "VG_Annotations"
5. maker sure "data_splits.pickle" (already included) is under "VG_Splits"
6. 
Note: for fair comparison with SOTA:
	1. we make sure train split doesn't have overlap with any test split of other datasets
	2. we take val set of coco as test split of vg and the rest of vg as train split
